*Yep, that’s me — hello there!*

# 👋 Hey everyone!

Welcome to my very first blog post!  
I'm **Anirudh**, a computer science student, cybersecurity learner, and someone who’s been exploring all sorts of tech paths—from web development to DSA to cybersecurity.

This blog marks the beginning of a new journey where I want to document what I learn, what I build, and how I grow.
